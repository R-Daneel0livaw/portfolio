        <h2>Education and Professional Journey</h2>
        <p>
          I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, complemented by a
          minor in Mathematics, from the esteemed SUNY Brockport. With nearly 15
          years of professional experience, my journey has been shaped by
          meaningful contributions to the Financial and Retirement industry.
          I've had the privilege of working with some of the world's largest
          retirement providers, gaining valuable insights and expertise along
          the way.

          My enthusiasm for technology extends beyond the workplace. I'm not
          only a tech professional but also a dedicated lifelong learner.
          Whether it's staying abreast of the latest industry trends or delving
          into new programming languages, I find joy in the continuous evolution
          of the tech landscape.

        <h2>Freelance Web Development</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to my corporate experience, I've ventured into the realm
          of freelance web development. Building websites has been a rewarding
          journey, allowing me to leverage my skills and creativity to deliver

        <h2>Hobbies: A Balanced Blend</h2>
        <p>
          Outside the world of coding and technology, I have a deep love for
          literature. You might find me engrossed in a good book or exploring
          the realms of knowledge through audiobooks. History, Philosophy, Logic, and
          Robotics are subjects that captivate my curiosity, and I'm always eager
          to delve into their depths.
